				  	<h2>Travel</h2>
				  	<p>I love to travel around the world, it allows me to discover different cultures and sceneries. It makes me go out of my routine and it broadens my horizons, I’ve already been to a lot of places, and I plan to visit a lot more countries.

				  	<h2>Swimming</h2>
				  	<p>I also enjoy swimming, I used to practice weekly for 8 years. It allows me to be competitive, to believe in my own abilities since it’s an individual sport. Beyond that, it is a sport that helps you to reflect and keep shape in the water.

				  	<h2>Cinema </h2>
				  	<p>My love for cinema began many years ago, I watch many movies every week. It’s a passion I inherited from my mother, she introduced me to old days films and I then started to search for new movies, the ones that are not so popular and found a pool of cinematographic opportunities.

				  	<h2>Music</h2>
				  	<p>I used to play cello and guitar for 5 years, but now I enjoy more listening to art then trying to create it. I’m always listening to music, all kinds of songs, from classical to rock to Arabic sounds, I pretty much enjoy everything.
